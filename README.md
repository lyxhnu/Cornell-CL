#  Introduction
1.This project proposes a three-branch RGB-D multimodal fusion module and integrates it into GR-Convnet.
2.This project proposes a continual learning strategy for 2D robotic grasping.
3.The network we trained is integrated into the robotic grasping system, which is capable of autonomously grasping objects of various shapes that have never been seen before.
# Show
We have deployed the algorithm into the robotic grasping system, which is capable of autonomously grasping objects of various shapes.
