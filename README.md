# A multi-branch multimodal fusion and continual learning method for robotic grasping

This is a method related to RGB-D multimodal fusion and continual learning for 2D grasping in general grasping scenarios, as described in the following paper:
A Grasp Detection Method Based on Continual Learning Using Perceptual Loss and Multi-Branch Deep Fusionï¼Œ

#  Introduction
1.This project proposes a three-branch RGB-D multimodal fusion module and integrates it into GR-Convnet.
2.This project proposes a continual learning strategy for 2D robotic grasping.
3.The network we trained is integrated into the robotic grasping system, which is capable of autonomously grasping objects of various shapes that have never been seen before.
# Show
We have deployed the algorithm into the robotic grasping system, which is capable of autonomously grasping objects of various shapes.
